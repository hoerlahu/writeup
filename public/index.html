                            My interest in IT security sparked when I was very young and watched the first iconic depictions of hacking in movies like "Hackers" and "Swordfish". I then proceeded to learn about some offensive applications and fooled around with RATs in my youth. Later in my professional career I got the opportunity to become the person in charge of IT security for a rather large project in the public sector. This gave me the ability to build indepth knowledge in most fields of security and to get hands on with other aspects of offensive security and penetration testing.

                    After being in consulting for some time I got the opportunity to be part of the management team of a rather large project in the public sector. During my years as a software developer I never was able to appreciated the work of the project management but i came to learn that the work is super important for every aspect of the development process. Enabling your colleagues to work without being interrupted and to protect them from loosing precious time while still conforming to the regulations that are imposed is a very satisfying thing to do. The challenges I face on a daily basis are incredibly divers and make every day unique and memorable.
